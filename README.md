# Workshop on Mathematical Modeling of Cognitive Processes 

This workshop is developed by Stephen Rhodes (@stephenrho) and Julia Haaf (@JuliaHaaf) at the Department of Psychological Sciences, University of Missouri.

## Description

This two day workshop covers the essentials of cognitive modeling in `R`. Attendees will be introduced to several commonly used models in cognitive psychology and how to fit them using both maximum likelihood and hierarchical Bayesian methods. While it is specifically aimed at graduate students in cognitive psychology, this workshop will be of interest to anyone looking to build their `R` modeling skills.

## Prerequisites

These are not absolutely required but would be useful:

- Passing familiarity with the [`R` programming language](https://www.r-project.org/). You can find a free online introduction [here](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r).
- Familiarity with statistical concepts such as likelihood.
